DeeperIntoSemantics
===================

This project is to take an existing web page and:
  1) rebuild semantic structure
  2) add microdata
  3) incorporate ARIA roles to enhance accessibility.

We chose to do the web page http://www.berlinerseattle.com/

The original page outlined to be just a single "Untitled Section". We rebuilt
its semantic structure to provide an outline of:

1. Who We Are
  1. Site Navigation
  2. The Berliner Donner Kebab
  3. What Is It? Something You Want!
    1. Details & Rave Reviews

We then filled in the outline providing HTML and adding microdata, using several
web resources including; schema.org, and Google to check for individual commands.

We then added ARIA roles, where it seemed that they would be useful. We used the
Mozilla Developer Network's ARIA pages and rawgit.com's W3C pages to provide implementation details.
